This is a C++ program to simulate a CPU scheduler 
which selects a processor from a ready queue and 
executes the process by given scheduling algorithm,
display information and it also calculates the 
average turn-around time, avarage waiting time, 
avarage response time, and Grantt Chartlike outputs.

4 scheduling algorithm:
	- FCFS (First Come First Serve)
	- SRTF (Shortest Remaining Task First)
	- RR (Round Robin)
	- PP(Preemptive Priority)

The program has been tested by using CLion IDE and 
csegrid on LINUX sucessfully.
